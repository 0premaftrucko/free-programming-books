# How to Create Realistic 3D Objects for Flight Simulator with Instant Object Maker
 
If you are a fan of flight simulation games, you might have wondered how to create your own custom objects for your scenery. Maybe you want to add your house, your car, or a sign that looks exactly like the real one. Or maybe you want to make some simple objects like trees, hangars, or vehicles that are not available in the default library.

One way to do that is to use a 3D modeling tool like Gmax or SketchUp, but those tools can be complicated and time-consuming to learn and use. You have to create an abstract 3D model of your object, then texture it with images, then export it to the right format for Flight Simulator.
 
But what if there was an easier way? A way that allows you to create realistic 3D objects for Flight Simulator using photographs or any other images? A way that does not require any 3D modeling skills or image editing skills? A way that is fast and simple?
 
That way is Instant Object Maker, a tool developed by FlightSimTools.com. Instant Object Maker is an easy-to-use tool that lets you make simple 3D objects for Flight Simulator by outlining individual polygons on one or more photographs and putting them together to form a 3D object. Instant Object Maker automatically generates scenery and texture files for you. You can also paint your own images and use them as textures for your objects.
 
With Instant Object Maker, you can make flat objects like road signs and billboards in less than a minute. You can also make more complex objects like cars, trees, and houses in just a few minutes. You can place your objects by entering coordinates, or create a library for use with Flight1's Instant Scenery object placement program.
 
Instant Object Maker is compatible with both FSX and FS2004. It has a special introduction price of $19.95 US and comes with a 30-day money back guarantee. You can download a free trial version that works for up to 30 days from [FlightSimTools.com](http://www.flightsimtools.com/iom/). You can also watch a 15-minute demonstration video on their website to see how it works.
 
If you want to create realistic 3D objects for Flight Simulator with ease and fun, try Instant Object Maker today!
  
## How Instant Object Maker Works
 
Instant Object Maker is based on a simple idea: you can create realistic 3D objects by cutting out individual polygons from photographs and arranging them in 3D space. For example, to make a car, you can use a photograph of a car and cut out the front, the sides, the back, the roof, and the wheels. Then you can position and rotate them to form a 3D car. Instant Object Maker will automatically generate the scenery and texture files for you.
 
You can use any image as a source for your polygons. You can use photographs that you have taken yourself, or downloaded from the internet. You can also use images that you have painted or drawn with an image editor. You can use multiple images for different parts of your object. For example, you can use one image for the body of the car, and another image for the license plate.
 
Instant Object Maker has a perspective correction function that allows you to use photographs taken at an angle. For example, if you have a photograph of a building taken from the ground level, you can use it to make a 3D building without distortion. You can also adjust the brightness, contrast, and color of your images to match the environment.
  
## How to Use Instant Object Maker
 
Instant Object Maker has a user-friendly interface that guides you through the steps of creating your object. You can also refer to the User's Manual for more information and tips.
 
The basic steps are:
 
- Select an image file to use as a source for your polygons.
- Draw the outline of each polygon on the image using the mouse.
- Assign a name and a size to each polygon.
- Arrange the polygons in 3D space using the mouse or keyboard.
- Save your object as a BGL file or a library file.

You can also edit your object by adding, deleting, moving, rotating, scaling, or flipping polygons. You can also change the properties of your object such as altitude, heading, pitch, roll, or scale.
  
## How to Place Your Object in Flight Simulator
 
There are two ways to place your object in Flight Simulator:

- By entering coordinates: You can enter the latitude and longitude of your object in Instant Object Maker and save it as a BGL file. Then you can copy the BGL file to your Flight Simulator scenery folder and activate it in the Scenery Library.
- By creating a library: You can save your object as a library file in Instant Object Maker and copy it to your Flight Simulator scenery folder. Then you can use Flight1's Instant Scenery program to place your object anywhere in the world using an easy drag-and-drop interface.

You can also use other scenery design tools that support library objects to place your object in Flight Simulator.
